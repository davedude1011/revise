    A little boat tied to a willow tree
    Within a rocky cove, its usual home.
    Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in
    Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth
    And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice
    Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;
    Leaving behind her still, on either side,
    Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
    Until they melted all into one track
    Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,
    Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point
    With an unswerving line, I fixed my view
    Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,
    The horizon's utmost boundary; far above
    Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
    She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
    I dipped my oars into the silent lake,
    And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat
    Went heaving through the water like a swan;
    When, from behind that craggy steep till then
    The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,
    As if with voluntary power instinct,
    Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,
    And growing still in stature the grim shape
    Towered up between me and the stars, and still,
    For so it seemed, with purpose of its own
    And measured motion like a living thing,
    Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,
    And through the silent water stole my way
    Back to the covert of the willow tree;
    There in her mooring-place I left my bark, -
    And through the meadows homeward went, in grave
    And serious mood; but after I had seen
    That spectacle, for many days, my brain
    Worked with a dim and undetermined sense
    Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts
    There hung a darkness, call it solitude
    Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes
    Remained, no pleasant images of trees,
    Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
    But huge and mighty forms, that do not live
    Like living men, moved slowly through the mind
    By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.`},{type:"header",content:"Summary"},{type:"text",content:`"The Prelude" is a long, autobiographical poem by William Wordsworth, written in blank verse.

    Looking as if she were alive. I call
    That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf's hands

    "Frà Pandolf" by design, for never read
    Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
    The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
    But to myself they turned (since none puts by
    The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
    And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
    How such a glance came there; so, not the first

    Must never hope to reproduce the faint
    Half-flush that dies along her throat": such stuff
    Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough

    Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er

    The dropping of the daylight in the West,
    The bough of cherries some officious fool
    Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
    She rode with round the terrace—all and each
    Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
    Or blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked
    Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
    My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
    With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame
    This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
    In speech—which I have not—to make your will
    Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just this
    Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
    Or there exceed the mark"—and if she let
    Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
    Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,
    —E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose
    Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,
    Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
    Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
    Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
    As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet
    The company below, then. I repeat,
    The Count your master's known munificence
    Is ample warrant that no just pretence
    Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;

    spasms of paper red, disrupting a blockade
    of yellow bias binding around your blazer.
    Sellotape bandaged around my hand,
    I rounded up as many white cat hairs
    as I could, smoothed down your shirt’s
    upturned collar, steeled the softening
    of my face. I wanted to graze my nose
    across the tip of your nose, play at

    to run my fingers through the gelled
    blackthorns of your hair. All my words
    flattened, rolled, turned into felt,
    slowly melting. I was brave, as I walked
    with you, to the front door, threw
    it open, the world overflowing
    like a treasure chest. A split second
    and you were away, intoxicated.
    After you’d gone I went into your bedroom,
    released a song bird from its cage.
    Later a single dove flew from the pear tree,
    and this is where it has led me,
    skirting the church yard walls, my stomach busy
    making tucks, darts, pleats, hat-less, without
    a winter coat or reinforcements of scarf, gloves.
    On reaching the top of the hill I traced
    the inscriptions on the war memorial,
    leaned against it like a wishbone.

    an ornamental stitch. I listened, hoping to hear

    flashing silver as their bellies
    swivelled towards the sun

    and his brothers waiting on the shore
    built cairns of pearl-grey pebbles
    to see whose withstood longest
    the turbulent inrush of breakers
    bringing their father’s boat safe

    - yes, grandfather’s boat – safe
    to the shore, salt-sodden, awash
    with cloud-marked mackerel,
    black crabs, feathery prawns,
    the loose silver of whitebait and once
    a tuna, the dark prince, muscular, dangerous.

    my mother never spoke again
    in his presence, nor did she meet his eyes
    and the neighbours too, they treated him
    as though he no longer existed,
    only we children still chattered and laughed

    till gradually we too learned
    to be silent, to live as though
